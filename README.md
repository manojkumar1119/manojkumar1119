# Hi, I'm Manoj! üëã

## About Me
I'm a Robotics Master's student at the University of Maryland, specializing in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research, where I developed a strong foundation in Programming and Embedded systems.
Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at YantraVision Software Pvt Ltd, focusing on AI Inspection and Deep learning acceleration. My experience includes AI-driven perception, computer vision, and FPGA-based optimizations for high-performance computing applications. I am deeply passionate about AI/ML/DL and their applications in robotic and  perception striving to build intelligent solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world implementations.
